# app/src/main/java/io/cocode/app/runtime/install/

## Responsibility

Builds the Alpine + Node + T3 Code + agent CLI environment in staging, verifies it, and activates it by an atomic directory swap. Also downloads and verifies the Alpine rootfs and the T3 Code server bundle, extracts them without a guest package manager, and recovers an environment swap that a process death interrupted.

## Design

- `RuntimeInstaller` (interface): `recover()`, `installedRuntime()`, `install(report, agents)`, `update(report, versions)`, `applyAgents(report, selected)`, `discardEnvironment()`, `removeAll()`. `RuntimeInstallerImpl` implements it over the on-disk layout and is not thread-safe, since the controller serialises calls.
- `RuntimeMetadata` (serialized to `environment/metadata.json`): `runtimeVersion`, `alpineVersion`, `abi`, `port`, `t3Version`, `agents` (id to installed version), `nodeVersion`, `installedAt`.
- `PackageVersions` (`t3` plus an agent id to version map) and `PackageVersionSource` (`latest(pinned)`).
- `T3ReleaseSource` / `GithubT3ReleaseSource`: `latest()` reads `GET https://api.github.com/repos/<repo>/releases/latest`, accepts only tags shaped `v<x.y.z>-pw.<n>` and returns a `T3Release` with the GitHub download base. It returns null on any failure, so the installer and the update check fall back to the manifest's pinned version. `sha256Sums()` fetches `SHA256SUMS` and parses `<sha256>  <file>` lines (an optional `*` marks binary mode).
- `NpmPackageVersionSource`: latest stable npm version of one package (abbreviated registry metadata, 15 s timeout, injectable base URL). No major-version lock for agents; never below the installed version.
- `DefaultPackageVersionSource`: combines the GitHub release with npm for all manifest agents. A GitHub failure uses the manifest fallback; an npm failure throws so the controller reports `checkFailed`.
- `RuntimeEnvironmentInstaller`: the pipeline. Its nested `GuestRunner` runs `/bin/sh -lc` inside PRoot with `ProotCommands`, streams output to `InstallReporter.log` and `logs/install.log`, and enforces a timeout. On timeout or interrupt, `awaitExit` kills the PRoot tree and waits for the launcher before returning. The live DNS monitor is not part of install: `configureRootfs` writes resolv.conf once, from the system DNS at that moment.
  - `install`: Alpine, apk (`nodejs npm bash git curl ripgrep openssh-client ca-certificates libstdc++ python3`, no build toolchain), shim, resolve the T3 release, verify and extract the bundle, PTY smoke, selected agents from npm, verify, metadata, swap.
  - `installServer`: resolves the asset name from `assetPattern` and the ABI→arch map, downloads `SHA256SUMS` (fail closed when the asset is missing), downloads the tarball through `VerifiedRuntimeDownloader` with that SHA-256, extracts into `rootfs/opt/t3` with `stripComponents = 1`, and checks `bin.mjs`, `client/index.html`, and `ANDROID-BUNDLE.json` (`version`, `arch`).
  - `update`: requires an active environment with metadata. It checks free space (`treeSize` + 512 MiB, else `UpdateNotEnoughSpace`), copies the environment with `copyTreeStrict`, clears the copied marker, normalizes the links into staging, removes changed agent packages host-side, refreshes resolv.conf, extracts the new T3 bundle, runs the PTY smoke, reinstalls changed agents at their target versions, verifies, writes metadata and swaps. Failure deletes staging only.
  - `applyAgents`: in-place on the active environment (the server is stopped): remove packages that are no longer selected, install new ones from npm, verify every selected agent, then replace `metadata.json` atomically. No staging copy: a selection change moves a few packages, not the whole rootfs.
- `GuestOutputPump` (internal): reads a guest command's combined output on a daemon thread and passes each line to `onLine`. Two entry points, both bounded by a caller-supplied deadline:
  - `drain(deadline)`: normal exit. Waits for end-of-stream so trailing lines are delivered. An unfinished reader returns `ReaderStillRunning`.
  - `abort(deadline)`: timeout, interrupt or error. Sets `closing` (no new line starts delivery), closes the stream on a helper thread, and joins both within the deadline. An interrupt is restored and returned.
  - Failure rules: an `IOException` from the read is expected only after `abort` or when the child is gone. An error from `onLine` is always a failure, including an `IOException`.
  - Limits: the deadline bounds how long the caller waits. It does not stop work already running. An `onLine` call in progress can finish after `abort` returns. A reader or a blocked `close()` that outlives the deadline is abandoned as a daemon thread, and it is not guaranteed to exit. The caller reads lines through a thread-safe snapshot only.
- `GuestOutputPump.awaitAndTearDown(...)`: the production orchestration `GuestRunner.run` calls. The teardown deadline is created only after `awaitCommand` returns, so a long command never spends the teardown budget.
- `GuestRunner.mustSucceed` reads its lines through a synchronised list and takes a snapshot before it classifies the output.
- `EnvironmentActivation.kt`: swap protocol (see Flow). Also `normalizeRuntimeSymlinks(environment, writeMarker = true)`, which keeps PRoot link2symlink links working at the final path. PRoot resolves its `.l2s.` intermediates only through **absolute** targets, and a relative target makes Node load `pty.node` as JavaScript. The rules:
  - An absolute target under `environment`, `environment.staging` or `environment.rollback` (or the `/data/data` ↔ `/data/user/N` spellings) is retargeted to the same relative location under the **PRoot host spelling** of this environment (`prootHostSpelling`). It stays absolute. `/data/user/0/<pkg>` maps to `/data/data/<pkg>`, which is what PRoot records and what the app process resolves. Other users (`/data/user/N`, N≠0) and non-`/data` paths are unchanged.
  - A relative target named `.l2s.*` (older v2 output) is made absolute under the link's directory, in the PRoot spelling, if it stays inside the environment.
  - Other links are untouched: npm's relative bin links, and guest-absolute targets such as `/usr/lib/...`.
  - Marker `.internal-symlinks-relative` = `absolute-l2s-v4`, written only at the end of a full pass. Older markers (`normalized-v2`, `absolute-l2s-v3`) are repaired. With `writeMarker = false` (staging) no marker is written. `clearSymlinkMarker` removes it.
- `VerifiedRuntimeDownloader`: validates the download URL and parameters, then uses OkHttp with a SHA-256 pin and optional expected size. After recovering `.backup`, it verifies the destination hash (and optional size) before networking; a valid cached destination succeeds directly and stale `.partial`/`.backup` files are cleaned up. It resumes through `.partial` with Range, restarts from zero on a 200 response, and treats 416 by discarding the partial. Uses `.backup` during destination replacement. Requires HTTPS, except loopback hosts.
- `RuntimeArchive`: `verifySha256`, `extractTarGz(input, destination, stripComponents = 0)` and `extractDebianPackage`. Rejects entries that escape the destination. Hard links fall back to byte copies. Symlinks are resolved after all entries are written, deepest first, to handle merged-/usr layouts.
- `InstallReporter` receives `step` and `log`.
- `NetworkFailure`: recognises apk/npm output markers such as `EAI_AGAIN`, `ETIMEDOUT`, `bad address`, and maps them to `MessageKey.MirrorsUnreachable`.

Invariants:
- The active environment is untouched until the commit rename. Metadata is written inside staging, so the rename commits it too.
- `installedRuntime()` returns null unless `metadata.json` parses, the `rootfs/` directory exists, `opt/t3/bin.mjs` exists, and `abi` matches.
- A T3 bundle is never extracted without a checksum from `SHA256SUMS`.
- The PTY smoke test against the bundled `/opt/t3/node_modules/node-pty` must pass before verify.

## Flow

Install (`RuntimeEnvironmentInstaller.install`):
1. `deleteTreeOrThrow(staging)`, then `mkdirs` for cache, logs, proot-tmp and home.
2. DownloadRootfs: `VerifiedRuntimeDownloader` fetches the Alpine tarball from `architecture.alpineUrl` to `cache/alpine-<ver>-<abi>.tar.gz`, verified by `alpineSha256`.
3. ExtractRootfs: `extractTarGz` into `staging/rootfs`, then `configureRootfs` (resolv.conf from `SystemDnsProvider`, `/etc/hosts`, libapk SONAME symlink) and `seedHome`.
4. InstallPackages: `apk add nodejs npm bash git curl ripgrep openssh-client ca-certificates libstdc++ python3` (`set -e`, 20 min).
5. Write `/opt/cocode/android-shim.cjs` (before npm).
6. InstallServer: resolve the latest T3 release (manifest fallback), fetch `SHA256SUMS`, download and verify the ABI tarball, extract into `/opt/t3`, check the bundle.
7. PTY smoke test (2 min).
8. InstallAgents: `npm i -g --no-fund --no-audit <selected packages>` (30 min), then `--version` for each.
9. Verify: `node --version`, the T3 bundle files and `ANDROID-BUNDLE.json`.
10. Write `metadata.json` in staging. Then `activateRuntimeEnvironment(active, staging, rollback)`.
11. On any throwable: `deleteTree(staging)`, then rethrow.

Update (`RuntimeEnvironmentInstaller.update`, no Alpine download):
1. `deleteTreeOrThrow(staging)`. Check free space (`treeSize(environment)` + 512 MiB), else `UpdateNotEnoughSpace`.
2. CopyEnvironment: `copyTreeStrict(environment, staging)`. Symlinks are kept as-is, modes are kept, and any failing entry fails the copy. Then clear the copied marker and write resolv.conf into the copy.
3. Remove changed agent packages host-side (no-follow delete of `usr/local/lib/node_modules/<pkg>` and the bin links). Reason: npm's in-place upgrade over PRoot's faked hard links (`.l2s.*` chains) leaves the binary broken ("Operation not permitted" / "not found"), so verify fails. A clean reinstall works (verified on device).
4. Extract the new T3 bundle (the verified download is cached, so an unchanged version is offline) and run the PTY smoke.
5. `npm i -g` the changed agents at their target versions, verify all selected agents, write metadata, swap.
6. Any throwable: `deleteTree(staging)`, then rethrow. The active environment is untouched.

ApplyAgents (`RuntimeEnvironmentInstaller.applyAgents`, server stopped):
1. Remove the packages of agents that are no longer selected.
2. Install newly selected agents from npm at their latest versions.
3. Verify every selected agent, then replace `metadata.json` atomically. A failure before the metadata write keeps the previous record.

Swap (`activateRuntimeEnvironment`):
1. Delete leftover `rollback` (only committed garbage can be there).
2. Clear the staging marker. No normalization runs on staging, because absolute targets under staging do not survive the rename. The commit happens in step 4.
3. Rename `environment` → `rollback` (uncommitted; on failure, move back).
4. Rename `staging` → `environment`. COMMIT POINT.
5. `deleteTree(rollback)`. A failure here does not undo the commit.
6. `normalizeRuntimeSymlinks(environment)` on the committed environment. A failure is logged and does not undo the commit. Without a marker, `installedRuntime()` runs it again.

Recovery (`recoverInterruptedRuntimeEnvironment`, at every detection):
- rollback present, environment absent: move rollback back (pre-commit crash).
- both present: delete rollback (post-commit crash).

## Integration

- Controller: `runtime/LocalRuntimeController.kt` calls `recover`, `installedRuntime`, `install`, `update`, `applyAgents`, `removeAll`.
- Wiring: `di/AppModule.kt` builds `RuntimeInstallerImpl` with `VerifiedRuntimeDownloader(OkHttpClient)`, `GithubT3ReleaseSource(OkHttpClient, manifest.t3.repository)`, the manifest, and the shim asset.
- Depends on: `runtime/manifest/RuntimeManifest` (pins), `runtime/process/ProotCommands` and `EmbeddedCommandSuite` (launch), `runtime/process/ProcessTree` (kill on timeout), `runtime/network/ResolvConf`, `runtime/fs/SafeFiles`.
- External contracts:
  - Alpine tarball: HTTPS URL and SHA-256 from `runtime-manifest.json`.
  - T3 Code release: GitHub `doublepi123/t3code`, assets `t3-<version>-android-linux-<arch>-musl.tar.gz` and `SHA256SUMS`.
  - Agent CLIs: `@openai/codex` (`codex`), `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` (`claude`), `@opencode/cli` (`opencode`, `opencode2`).
  - Guest paths: `/opt/t3` (`bin.mjs`, `client/index.html`, `node_modules/node-pty`, `ANDROID-BUNDLE.json`), `/opt/cocode/android-shim.cjs`, `/opt/cocode/pty-smoke.cjs`.
  - `metadata.json` fields: `runtimeVersion`, `alpineVersion`, `abi`, `port`, `t3Version`, `agents`, `nodeVersion`, `installedAt`.
